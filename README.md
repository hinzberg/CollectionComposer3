#  CollectionComposer 3

This is a small tool to copy a random number of files from different source folders to a destination folder. As an additional option, you can specify that the files must contain certain keywords in the filename.

**Application example**

Imagine you have different folders with vacation photos. Each folder is named after a place you've been. Now you want a random collection of 100 pictures from these places. In addition, the pictures should contain certain keywords in the filename. For example "sunset" or "mountains".
